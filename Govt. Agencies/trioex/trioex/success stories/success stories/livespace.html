		<p class="post-lede">Livspace is a personalized home design and decor marketplace that connects interior designers, vendors, and customers.</p> 
	  
		<p>By connecting vendors and designers to homeowners, the platform is acting as a marketplace for home design. It charges a commission or margin fee for all transactions, which range from INR 1 Lakh to over INR 50 Lakh.</p>
	  
		<p>Anuj and Ramakant, Livspace founders and college friends, were just like any other homeowner—they simply wanted good interiors. Instead, they got a rather appalling experience. It started with trouble in finding the right professionals. It ended with the realization that even after spending a lot of time and money one could never be sure of a fair price, quality, or even the final result. When they, Anuj Srivastava and Ramakant Sharma, set upon their journeys to design their dream homes, soon they found that the industry is really fragmented, where some factors like discovering the right professionals, managing tasks coordinatedly, and ensuring fair price and quality were some of the prominent pain points that people usually face. This is why they were determined to fix this and extend an experience that would truely be happy for the homeowners. This way they went ahead to build a much-needed bridge for the industry in the form of Livspace, which was founded in 2014 as a complete home interior design and renovation solution that is currently helping thousands of homeowners.</p>
	  
		<h1 class="alakh">Anuj Srivastava(Founder's Corner)</h1>
		<p>Anuj is an IIT Kanpur graduate, who also has an MBA from the London Business School. Srivastava is currently known as the CEO and Co-founder of Livspace. Before founding Livspace, Anuj has served as a Manager in Pepsico, a Head of Product Marketing and Alliance at Encentuate. He also has over 7 years experience of serving as the Global Head of Product Marketing & Growth: Google Commerce & Mobile Payments, Maps/Local, AdSense, after which he founded Livspace</p>
	  
		<p>Home interiors and renovation platform Livspace has entered the Singapore market. Through a six-month-long pilot, the startup said that it already has a $15 million gross revenue run rate and is growing at 25% month-on-month.

            Livspace has also mentioned that it would invest $30 million to grow its business in Singapore – drive demand, hire talent, build design experience centers and develop a regional supply chain.</p>
